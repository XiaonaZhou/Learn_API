# Introduction

This notebook summarizes the basics of APIs from an article posted on DATAQUEST, [R API Tutorial: Getting Started with APIs in R](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/r-api-tutorial/). An example on how to get data through Open Notify API is demonstrated here. 

# Making API request in R

Load libraries
```{r}
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
```

Use `GET` to make request. 
Syntax: `GET('API's URL')`

```{r}
res = GET("http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json")
res
```

Note: Status: 200 means success. Check the means of other numbers [here](https://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html)


Convert the content in `res` to usable data in R.
```{r}
data = fromJSON(rawToChar(res$content))
names(data)
```
Access the data
```{r}
data$people
```
```{r}
data$number
```
```{r}
data$message
```
